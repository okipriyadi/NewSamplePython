"""
The most basic form of help for developers is the documentation for code they
are using. The pydoc module generates formatted reference documentation from the
docstrings included in the source code for any importable module

The pydoc module imports a Python module and uses the contents to generate help
text at runtime. The output includes docstrings for any objects that have them, and all
the classes, methods, and functions of the module are described.
