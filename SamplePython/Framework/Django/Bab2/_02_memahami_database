Looked at simply, the Web is about data transfer or the sharing of content (meaning, quite
literally, anything—blog entries, financial data, ebooks, and so forth). In the Web’s early
days, content consisted of HTML text files, written by hand, and stored on the server’s
filesystem.This is known as static because requests to the same URL always return the
same information.The “path” described previously was more primitive; there were no
parameters, as it was merely a path on the server’s filesystem where the static content was
located. Present day, most content is considered dynamic because the data returned by a
given URL can vary tremendously depending on factors.
A large part of this dynamic nature is enabled by storing data in a database, where
instead of a single string of text, one can create multipart pieces of data and link them to
one another to represent relationships.To define and query the database, SQL (Structured
Query Language) is used, often further abstracted by an ORM (Object-Relational Map-
per), which enables object-oriented programming languages to represent the database as
code objects.

SQL databases are organized into tables, each consisting of rows (for example, entries,
items, objects) and columns (for example, attributes, fields), similar in overall organization
to a spreadsheet. Django provides a powerful ORM, where Python classes represent
tables, objects represent individual rows within those tables, and the table’s columns are
attributes of those objects
