The capability to define relationships between model objects is, naturally, one of the
strongest selling points for using relational databases (as evidenced by the name itself—
relational) and is also an area where ORMs sometimes tend to differ from one another.

Django’s current implementation is fairly database-centric, making sure the relations are
defined at the database level and not just at the application level. However, because SQL
only provides for one explicit form of relation—the foreign key—it is necessary to add
some layering to provide more complex relationships.We examine the foreign key first
and then move to how it can serve as a building block for the other relationship types.
