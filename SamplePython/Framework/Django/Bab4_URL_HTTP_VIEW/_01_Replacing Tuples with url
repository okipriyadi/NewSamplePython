A relatively late addition to Django’s URL dispatching mechanism is the url method,
which is designed to replace the tuples outlined previously while remaining nearly identi-
cal in structure. It takes the same three “arguments”
1. a regex, 
2. a view string/function, 
3. and optional argument dict—and adds another optional, 

named argument: name .
name is simply a string, which should be unique among all your URLs; then, you can use it elsewhere
to refer back to this specific URL.

Let’s rewrite the previous example using url .
=====================================================================================
from django.conf.urls.defaults import *

urlpatterns = patterns(‘myproject.myapp.views’,
					    url(r’^$’, ‘index’, name=’index’),
  						url(r’^archives/(?P<year>\d{4})/(?P<month>\d{2})/(?P<day>\d{2})/$’, 
  						    ‘archive’, name=’archive’),
						)
=====================================================================================
NOTE :
don't use it again from django.conf.urls import patterns
You should use a list because patterns() is deprecated since version 1.8, and will be removed in 1.10:
sebagai gantinya pake
===========================================================+
from django.conf.urls import url    
    urlpatterns =  [
            url(r'^$', archive),
        ]
===========================================================+

NOTE : Versi django 10 tidak akan ada lagi django.conf.urls.defaults.patterns sehingga bisa diubah menjadi 
As you can see, it’s a simple drop-in replacement for the older tuple syntax. Because it’s
an actual function and not just a tuple, it enforces what used to be merely a convention.
The first two arguments are required and have no name, although the argument dict is
now an optional named argument, kwargs , along with the new optional named argu-
ment, "name".

Note
kwargs and name are named arguments instead of positional ones to support the fact they
are both optional. You can specify neither of them, either of them, or both without running
into problems. Positional arguments (or the use of tuples) would make such a setup far
more difficult.

We’re presenting this url approach after the tuple-based syntax because it’s newer; even
by the time you read this, there are still likely to be more Django URLconfs out in the
wild utilizing tuples than using url . However, we strongly encourage you to use url in
your own code; we have endeavored to set a good example by using it in the rest of this
book because it offers more power and flexibility than the tuple approach.
Finally, see the example applications in Part III,“Django Applications by Example,” for
more information on the name argument and how it can be used to reference back to
your URLs from other parts of the code.
