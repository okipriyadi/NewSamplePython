Every user in our project will have a profile with a unique URL in the following
format: http://127.0.0.1:8000/user/<username> .

eg:

from django.conf.urls import patterns, include, url
from django.contrib import admin
from tweet.views import Index,Profile

urlpatterns = patterns('',
					url(r'^$', Index.as_view()),
					url(r'^user/(\w+)/$', Profile.as_view()),
					url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
				)
				
The annotation \w
means an alphanumeric character or the underscore. The + sign after it causes the
regular expression to match one or more repetitions of what precedes the sign. So,
in effect, \w+ means any string that consists of alphanumeric characters and possibly
the underscore. We have surrounded this portion of the regular expression with
parentheses. This will cause Django to capture the string that matches this portion
and pass it to the view.
