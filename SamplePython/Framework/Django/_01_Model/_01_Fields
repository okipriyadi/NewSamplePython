slug :  This is a field intended to be used in URLs. A slug is a short label
		containing only letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens. We will use the
		slug field to build beautiful, SEO-friendly URLs for our blog posts. We have
		added the unique_for_date parameter to this field so we can build URLs
		for posts using the date and slug of the post. Django will prevent from
		multiple posts having the same slug for the same date.
