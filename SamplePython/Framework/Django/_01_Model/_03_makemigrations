To create a data table for our model in the database. Django comes with a
migration system to track the changes you do to your models and propagate them
into the database. The migrate command applies migrations for all applications
listed in INSTALLED_APPS ; it synchronizes the database with the current models
and migrations.

irst, we need to create a migration for the new model we just created. From the root
directory of your project, enter this command:
==============================================
	python manage.py makemigrations 'your app'
	ex : python manage.py makemigrations blog
==============================================
You should get the following output:
Migrations for 'blog':
0001_initial.py:
- Create model Post

If you edit your models.py file in order to add, remove, or change fields of existing
models, or if you add new models, you will have to make a new migration using the
makemigrations command. The migration will allow Django to keep track of model
changes. Then you will have to apply it with the migrate command to keep the
database in sync with your models.
