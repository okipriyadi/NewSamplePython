use 'migrate' to apply existing migrations
===================================

We just applied migrations for the applications listed in INSTALLED_APPS

If you edit your models.py file in order to add, remove, or change fields of existing
models, or if you add new models, you will have to make a new migration using the
makemigrations command. The migration will allow Django to keep track of model
changes. Then you will have to apply it with the migrate command to keep the
database in sync with your models.
