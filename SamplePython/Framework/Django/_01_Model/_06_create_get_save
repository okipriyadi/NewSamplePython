Open the terminal and run the following command to open the Python shell:
python manage.py shell
Then type the following lines:
===========================================================
	from django.contrib.auth.models import User
	from blog.models import Post
	user = User.objects.get(username='admin')
	#This object direct to the database.
	Post.objects.create(title='One more post', 
						slug='one-more-post',
						body='Post body.',
						author=user)
	#This object is in memory and is not persisted to the database.
	'''
	post = Post(title='Another post', 
				slug='another-post', 
				body='Post body.', 
				author=user)
	'''
	#Finally, we save the Post object to the database using the save() method
	post.save()
===========================================================
Let's analyze what this code does. First, we retrieve the user object that has the
username admin :

user = User.objects.get(username='admin')
The get() method allows you to retrieve a single object from the database. Note that
this method expects one result that matches the query. If no results are returned by
the database, this method will raise a DoesNotExist exception, and if the database
returns more than one result, it will raise a MultipleObjectsReturned exception.
Both exceptions are attributes of the model class that the query is being performed on.
