name_obejct = name_Model.objects.all()    => meretrieve semua data di model tertentu
ex: 
all_posts = Post.objects.all()



This is how we create a QuerySet that returns all objects in the database. Note
that this QuerySet has not been executed yet. Django QuerySets are lazy; they are
only evaluated when they are forced to do it. This behavior makes QuerySets very
efficient. If we don't set the QuerySet to a variable, but instead write it directly on
the Python shell, the SQL statement of the QuerySet is executed because we force
it to output results:


slice: 
Post.objects.all()[:3]
