You can exclude certain results from your QuerySet using the exclude() method
of the manager. For example, we can retrieve all posts published in 2015 whose
titles don't start by Why :
=========================================================================
	Post.objects.filter(publish__year=2015).exclude(title__startswith='Why')
=========================================================================
