In order for Django to keep track of our application and be able to create database
tables for its models, we have to activate it. To do this, edit the settings.py file
and add "our apps" to the INSTALLED_APPS setting. if we create app called "blog" It should look like this:

INSTALLED_APPS = (
'django.contrib.admin',
'django.contrib.auth',
'django.contrib.contenttypes',
'django.contrib.sessions',
'django.contrib.messages',
'django.contrib.staticfiles',
'blog',
)
