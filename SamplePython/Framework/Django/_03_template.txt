Your first template!

Creating a template means creating a template file. Everything is a file, right? You have probably noticed this already.

Templates are saved in blog/templates/blog directory. So first create a directory called templates inside your blog directory. Then create another directory called blog inside your templates directory:

blog
└───templates
    └───blog
(You might wonder why we need two directories both called blog - as you will discover later, this is simply a useful naming convention that makes life easier when things start to get more complicated.)

And now create a post_list.html file (just leave it blank for now) inside the blog/templates/blog directory.
