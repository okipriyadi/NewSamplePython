comments.
count() . Note that Django template language doesn't use parentheses for calling
methods. The {% with %} tag allows us to assign a value to a new variable that
will be available to be used until the {% endwith %} tag

We use the pluralize template filter to display a plural suffix for the word comment
depending on the total_comments value. Template filters take the value of the
variable they are applied to as input and return a computed value.

The pluralize template filter displays an " s " if the value is different than 1 . The
preceding text will be rendered as 0 comments, 1 comment, or N comments.
