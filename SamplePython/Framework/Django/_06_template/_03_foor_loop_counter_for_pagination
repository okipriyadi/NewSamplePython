question:
I am using django-pagination to paginate my object list. It is working flawlessly. 
I want to give a number to each object on the page and I am using {{forloop.counter}} for that, 
but the problem is it starts the object count from 1 on each page. I wanted to display the actual object count.

Say if I am paginating 10 objects per page, then I want to object number as 11 for the first object on page 2. 
I tried writing a template filter for this, but somehow I am not able to send both request.get.page and 
{{forloop.counter}} to my filter function. I am unable to do it that way

Answer:
You can use the add template tag to add the current count from the paginator to the forloop

{{ forloop.counter|add:paginator.page.start_index }}
