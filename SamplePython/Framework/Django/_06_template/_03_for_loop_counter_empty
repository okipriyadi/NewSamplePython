{% for comment in comments %}
	<div class="comment">
		<p class="info">
		Comment {{ forloop.counter }} by {{ comment.name }}

	<p>There are no comments yet.</p>
{% endfor %}


We use the {% for %} template tag to loop through comments. We display a default
message if the comments list is empty, telling our users there are no comments for
this post yet. We enumerate comments with the {{ forloop.counter }} variable,
which contains the loop counter in each iteration


Variabel

Deskripsi

forloop.counter			:	The current iteration of the loop (1-indexed)
forloop.counter0		:	The current iteration of the loop (0-indexed)
forloop.revcounter		:	The number of iterations from the end of the loop (1-indexed)
forloop.revcounter0		:	The number of iterations from the end of the loop (0-indexed)
forloop.first			:	True if this is the first time through the loop
forloop.last			:	True if this is the last time through the loop
forloop.parentloop		:	For nested loops, this is the loop surrounding the current one

for ... empty¶

The for tag can take an optional {% empty %} clause whose text is displayed if the given array is empty or could not be found:

<ul>
{% for athlete in athlete_list %}
    <li>{{ athlete.name }}</li>
{% empty %}
    <li>Sorry, no athletes in this list.</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
The above is equivalent to – but shorter, cleaner, and possibly faster than – the following:

<ul>
  {% if athlete_list %}
    {% for athlete in athlete_list %}
      <li>{{ athlete.name }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
  {% else %}
    <li>Sorry, no athletes in this list.</li>
  {% endif %}
</ul>
