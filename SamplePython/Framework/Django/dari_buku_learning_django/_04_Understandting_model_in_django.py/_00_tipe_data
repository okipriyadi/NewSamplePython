Field_type			Description	
IntegerField		An integer 
TextField 			A large text field
DateTimeField 		A date-and-time field
EmailField 			An e-mail field with 75 characters maximum
URLField 			A URL field with 200 characters maximum
FileField 			A file-upload field


The following are the arguments that can be applied to all the field types (they
are optional):
•	 null : By default, it is set to false . When set to true , the associated field is
			allowed to have a value of null stored in the database.
•   blank : By default, it is set to false . When set to true , the associated field is
			allowed to have a value of blank stored in the database.			
• choices : This can be a list or a tuple and must be iterable. If this is in the
			form of a tuple, the first element is the value that will get stored to the
			database and the second value is used for display in widget-like forms or
			ModelChoiceField .
			For example:
				USER_ROLE = (
					('U', 'USER'),
					('S', 'STAFF'),
					('A', 'ADMIN')
					)
				user_role = models.CharField(max_length=1,choices=USER_ROLE)				
•	 default : Values that are assigned to the attribute every time an object of the
			   class is instantiated.
• help_text : Help text displayed in the form of a widget.
• primary_key : If set to True , this field is made primary key for the model. If
			there is no primary key in the model, Django will create an integer field and
			mark that as the primary key.
