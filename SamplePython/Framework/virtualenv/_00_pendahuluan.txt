With virtualenv you can create an isolated Python environment. It's not much of a need
in the beginning, but it's a lifesaver for dependency management (for example, if one of
your web applications requires one version of the library and another application, due
to some legacy or compatibility issues, requires another version of the same library, or if
changes made in one library or application break the rest of the applications).
Virtualenv can be used to avoid such problematic situations. It will create its own
environment so that it will not mess with your global settings. It usually creates its
own directories and shared libraries to make virtualenv work without any external
interference.
