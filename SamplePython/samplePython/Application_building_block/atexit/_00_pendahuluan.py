 fungsi atexit:
Purpose Register function(s) to be called when a program is closing
down.

The atexit module provides an interface to register functions to be called when a pro-
gram closes down normally. The sys module also provides a hook, sys.exitfunc ,
but only one function can be registered there. The atexit registry can be used by
multiple modules and libraries simultaneously.
