Python implements poll() with a class that manages the registered data channels
being monitored. Channels are added by calling register() , with flags indicating
which events are interesting for that channel. The full set of flags is listed in Table 11.1.

POLLIN        Input Ready
POLLPRI       Priority Input Ready
POLLOUT       Able to receive output
POLLERR       Error
POLLHUP        Channel Closed
POLLNVAL      Channel not Open

The echo server will be setting up some sockets just for reading and others to be
read from or written to. The appropriate combinations of flags are saved to the local
variables READ_ONLY and READ_WRITE .
