Operator 	Description 														Example
+ 			Addition - Adds values on either side of the operator 				a + b will give 5 ***ket a= 2 b =3
- 			Subtraction - Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand 	a - b will give -1
* 			Multiplication - Multiplies values on either side of the operator 	a * b will give 6
/ 			Division - Divides left hand operand by right hand operand 			b / a will give 2
% 			Modulus - Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and 
			returns remainder 													b % a will give 1
^ 			Exponentiation - This gives the exponent value of the right 
			hand operand 														a ^ b will give 8
|/ 			square root 														|/ 25.0 will give 5
||/ 		Cube root 															||/ 27.0 will give 3
!/ 			Factorial 															5 ! will give 120
!! 			factorial (prefix operator) 										!! 5 will give 120
Operator komparasi
= 			Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, 
			if yes then condition becomes true. 								(a = b) is not true.
!= 			Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, 
			if values are not equal then condition becomes true. 				(a != b) is true.
<> 			Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, 
			if values are not equal then condition becomes true. 				(a <> b) is true.
> 			Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of 
			right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. 					(a > b) is not true.
< 			Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of 
			right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. 					(a < b) is true.
>= 			Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to 
			the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. 	(a >= b) is not true.
<= 			Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to 
			the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. 	(a <= b) is true.
