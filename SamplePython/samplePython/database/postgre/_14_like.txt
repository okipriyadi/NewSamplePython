There are two wildcards used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:

- The percent sign (%)
- The underscore (_)

The percent sign represents zero, one, or multiple numbers or characters. The underscore represents a single
number or character. These symbols can be used in combinations

ex:
Statement									Description
WHERE SALARY::text LIKE '200%' 				Finds any values that start with 200
WHERE SALARY::text LIKE '%200%'				Finds any values that have 200 in any position

WHERE SALARY::text LIKE '2_%_%' 			Finds any values that start with 2 and are at least 3 characters inclength
WHERE SALARY::text LIKE '%2' 				Finds any values that end with 2
WHERE SALARY::text LIKE '_2%3' 				Finds any values that have a 2 in the second position and end with a 3
WHERE SALARY::text LIKE '2___3' 			Finds any values in a five-digit number that start with 2 and end with 3
