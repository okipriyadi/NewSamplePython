#akan dibuat file pdf di folder yang sama dimana file ini dijalankan
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas
 
c = canvas.Canvas("hello.pdf")
c.drawString(100,750,"Welcome to Reportlab!")
c.save()

"""
The first thing to notice about this code is that if we want to save the PDF, 
we need to supply a file name to the Canvas object. This can be an absolute path or a relative path.
In this example, it should create the PDF in the same location that you run the script from. 
The next piece of the puzzle is the drawString method. This will draw text wherever you tell it to.
When using the canvas object, it starts at the bottom left of the page, so for this example, 
we told it to draw the string 100 points from the left margin and 750 points from the bottom 
of the page (1 point = 1/72 inch). You can change this default in the Canvas constructor by 
passing a zero to the bottomup keyword argument.
The final piece in the code above is to save your PDF.
